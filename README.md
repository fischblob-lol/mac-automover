# mac-automover
Why use the trashcan when you can have a shitty vibe coded folder!
The term "auto mover" just moves files in a selected location.
Anyways, license GPL v3, feel free to do whatever the hell you want
Vibe coded btw :)
 But don't worry, I reviewed the code and you're fine.
Upcoming releases:
0.1 BETA: the one you're using
0.2 "why would I need this"
Ill probably change the releases names later
Currently only made for mac,probably will work on linux if you change the folder structure and a bit of the scripts I guess.
